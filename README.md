FizzBuzz
========

FizzBuzz for Android, with real Fizzing and real Buzzing.

FizzBuzz is an interview question used to assess programmers:
"Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100.
But for multiples of three print “Fizz” instead of the number and for the multiples of five print “Buzz”.
For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print “FizzBuzz”."

When I read this I thought it might be fun to make a version of FizzBuzz for Android which would really Fizz and really Buzz.
So here it is!
